        <p>The humble braised pork belly rice, also known as 滷肉饭, has been a comfort dish of mine for many years. What was once thought to be a difficult dish to master has become a common dish for me to cook at home. I learnt to cook this dish when I was studying abroad in the UK and shared it with my flatmates who absolutely loved it as well! Without further ado, let's get cracking with the recipe!</p>

            <li>1 mushroom of choice (optional)</li>
            <li>4 1cm-thick slices of pork belly</li>
            <li>70ml light soy sauce</li>
            <li>70-100ml Shaoxing wine (or any sort of cooking wine available)</li>

        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Chop the red onions, garlic, mushrooms, and pork belly into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the pork belly to your pot, frying it off on medium heat for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the onions, followed by the mushrooms and garlic, sauteeing it for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in about 3 tablespoons of light soy sauce to the pot to scrape the pork belly from the bottom of the pot, followed by the Shaoxing wine.</li>
            <li>Add in the rest of the light soy sauce followed by the brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Pour in approximately 100-200ml water and cover the pot, turning the heat down to a low simmer.</li>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2 class="tips">Tips</h2>
        <ul class="tips">
            <li>The longer you leave the pork to braise, the more tender and flavourful it will be.</li>
            <li>Keep an eye out to ensure the water does not boil off before the meat is done braising!</li>
            <li>This dish is best served with rice.</li>
            <li>As an optional step, you may add in a boiled egg while the meat is braising for a soy sauce braised egg as well.</li>
        </ul>
